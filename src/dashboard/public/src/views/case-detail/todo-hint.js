// todo-hint.js -- single-line priority-ladder "what to do now" hint, ported
// byte-for-byte in logic from the legacy app.js todoHint() (which itself
// mirrors src/attn.js caseHints()' priority ladder). Rendered as a Lede.
//
// Every literal 'casey' below is config-driven (dashboard_ui.brand, see
// app-view.js/case-list-view.js/activity-panel.js for the same pattern) --
// absent (casey's own default, uhh) it stays the literal 'casey'.
