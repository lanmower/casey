// GUARANTEED-RESPONSE FSM (typing indicator + bounded turnaround + explicit
// fallback message). USER DIRECTIVE: every LIVE first-attempt turn must end
// in either a real chat reply or an explicit, truthful "still working" /
// "having trouble" status message -- never total silence. This is a
// deliberate, scoped evolution of the no-fallback-text principle, not a
// reversal of it: the banned thing was always FABRICATED case content or a
// scripted apology standing in for real understanding (a mock). A truthful
// status update ("still working on this", "having trouble right now, please
// try again in a moment") invents nothing and claims nothing about the
// contact's case -- it is the same class of honesty as the existing loud
// log lines, just also shown to the contact. Applies only to a live,
// first-attempt turn that clears rate-limiting: excludes msg.resume /
// msg.queuedRedrive (background catch-up re-drives of an OLD message the
// contact has likely moved on from -- see the isBackgroundRedrive guard
// below), and excludes the rateLimited/globallyRateLimited early-returns
// further down (a deliberate pre-store admission-control gate -- no
// findOrCreateCase/recordInbound has run yet at that point, so there is no
// case timeline to attach a status message to).
//
// CASEY_TURN_HARD_DEADLINE_MS is the real, unconditional guarantee: the
// attempt loop below spends AT MOST this much total wall-clock time retrying
// (each individual attempt still gets to run its own bounded provider-chain
// walk -- ACPTOAPI_CHAIN_LINK_TIMEOUT_MS-per-hop, set to 60s in casey's own
// .env -- to real completion rather than being cut off mid-hop; this is the
// "completing through multiple samples" behavior the design calls for: a
// retry that starts with real remaining budget gets a genuine chance, not an
// arbitrarily truncated one). acptoapi's OWN shipped default for this
// timeout (chain-machine.js DEFAULT_LINK_TIMEOUT_MS) is 120s, not 20s -- a
// stale claim this comment used to make; casey's .env explicitly overrides
// it to 60s specifically because the upstream default alone would let one
// bad chain hop consume the whole hard-deadline budget on attempt 1 alone.
// A deployment missing that .env override silently inherits the wider 120s
// default (see AGENTS.md's Timeout Coordination section). Once the hard
// deadline is reached the loop stops retrying and the guaranteed-fallback
// text is composed and sent -- see the attempt loop's own remainingMs
// calculation for exactly how each attempt's budget is derived.
//
// CASEY_TURN_SOFT_DEADLINE_MS is NOT a second timeout gate -- it only picks
// which of the two fallback strings to send, based on how long the whole
// turn actually took: a turn that degraded FAST (under the soft deadline --
// a structural refusal, an immediate provider auth error) reads as "still
// working, one moment" since a quick follow-up message has a real chance of
// landing on a healthier attempt; a turn that ran long (spent real time
// genuinely retrying/waiting on providers, past the soft deadline) gets the
