// case-health.js  --  time-based guardrails: how a case goes WRONG OVER TIME.
//
// The lifecycle machine stops illegal STAGE moves, but it says nothing about a
// case that is technically in a legal stage yet quietly rotting -- a report that
// no one has touched in days, a stage a case has been stuck in far too long, a
// farmer who asked for a human and never got one, an intake abandoned with the
// on-site facts still missing. Those are the failures that lose a disease report,
// and the system had no notion of them.
//
// classifyCaseHealth is a PURE function of (case row, now, thresholds): no clock,
// no I/O. `now` is injected so every breach boundary is testable to the
// millisecond. It returns the list of breaches currently true for the case; the
// sweep layer turns that list into observable tags and notes.
